    "### Data Preparation\n",
    "\n",
    "Effective data preparation is a crucial step in fine-tuning Mistral Instruct for your chatbot application. The quality and relevance of your training data directly impact the performance and accuracy of the model. In this section, we will focus on curating and preprocessing datasets specifically for La Roche-Posay, a well-known skincare brand, ensuring that the chatbot can provide accurate and helpful responses related to skincare products and routines.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. Collecting Data\n",
    "\n",
    "The first step is to collect a diverse set of conversational data related to the task. This includes:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Customer Support Conversations**: Extract dialogues from customer support channels where common skincare concerns and product inquiries are discussed.\n",
    "- **Product Descriptions**: Gather detailed descriptions of skin care products, including ingredients, usage instructions, and benefits.\n",
    "- **FAQs**: Compile a list of frequently asked questions and answers from the company website or customer support.\n",
    "- **Reviews and Feedback**: Analyze customer reviews and feedback to understand common sentiments and issues.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. Structuring Data\n",
    "\n",
    "To ensure consistency and facilitate training, the collected data should be structured in a standardized format. We will use a simple JSON format where each conversation entry includes the following fields:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Context**: The initial query or context provided by the user.\n",
    "- **Response**: The expected response from the chatbot.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "```json\n",
    "{\n",
    "  \"conversations\": [\n",
    "    {\n",
    "      \"prompt\": \"Can you tell me more about the pimple serum?\",\n",
    "      \"completion\": \"Our serum is a dual-action acne treatment formulated with benzoyl peroxide and lipo-hydroxy acid. It helps to reduce acne, prevent future breakouts, and minimize the appearance of pores.\"\n",
    "    }\n",
    "  ]\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Another solution, which is applied here and highly suggested is that you format the messages yourself. When finetuning Mistral models, the expected for proper training is:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "\"<s>[INST] _context_ [/INST] _expected_chatbot_response </s>\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "This format will insure consistency and reduce any possibility of the model misunderstanding the task."

    "### Evaluation\n",
    "\n",
    "The evaluation of our fine-tuned Mistral Instruct model will be conducted in two parts: human evaluation and automated metrics. This comprehensive approach ensures both qualitative and quantitative insights into the model's performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Human Evaluation**\n",
    "\n",
    "In the first part of our evaluation, we will conduct human evaluations by engaging a streamer to interact with the chatbot. This will involve asking a variety of questions to assess the chatbot's ability to understand and respond accurately and naturally. Human evaluation is crucial as it provides real-world feedback on the conversational quality, relevance, and user satisfaction, which are difficult to measure through automated metrics alone.\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Automated Metrics**\n",
    "\n",
    "The second part involves using established automated metrics to quantitatively measure the performance of our model. The metrics we will use include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **F1 Score**: This metric will be used to evaluate the accuracy of the model in terms of precision and recall. It is particularly useful in determining how well the chatbot can provide correct answers (precision) and how often it provides correct answers out of the total number of answers it should provide (recall).\n",
    "\n",
    "- **ROUGE (Recall-Oriented Understudy for Gisting Evaluation)**: ROUGE metrics (such as ROUGE-N, ROUGE-L) will help us evaluate the quality of the generated text by comparing it to reference texts. It is commonly used to assess the quality of summaries and generated responses in NLP tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **BLEU (Bilingual Evaluation Understudy)**: BLEU score will be used to evaluate the accuracy and fluency of the chatbot's responses by comparing them with reference responses. It is particularly useful for tasks involving machine translation and text generation.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Perplexity**: This metric will be used to measure how well the probability distribution predicted by the model aligns with the actual distribution of the test data. Lower perplexity indicates better predictive performance, reflecting the model's ability to generate coherent and contextually appropriate responses.\n",
    "\n",
    "By combining human evaluations with these automated metrics, we aim to obtain a holistic understanding of the chatbot's performance, ensuring it meets both qualitative and quantitative standards for effective and engaging conversations.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this part you might want to reload the model and the  tokenizer.\n"

    "3. **Integration and Testing**: Steps to integrate the quantized model with vLLM and rigorous testing to verify the chatbot's responsiveness and accuracy in real-world scenarios.\n",
    "4. **Scalability and Maintenance**: Best practices for scaling the deployment to handle increased traffic and maintaining the system for long-term reliability and performance.\n",
