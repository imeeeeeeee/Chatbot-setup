# Mistral AI Chatbot Fine-Tuning with LoRA

This repository contains code and instructions to fine-tune the [Mistral](https://huggingface.co/models) language model using the LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) technique. The project focuses on optimizing the model for chatbot applications, utilizing efficient training methods to adapt the model to new conversational data. The project uses the Hugging Face library for model management and the `safetensors` format for secure and efficient model storage.

## Data Preparation

Effective data preparation is a crucial step in fine-tuning the Mistral Instruct model for your chatbot application. The quality and relevance of your training data directly impact the performance and accuracy of the model. In this section, we will focus on curating and preprocessing datasets specifically for a well-known skincare brand, ensuring that the chatbot can provide accurate and helpful responses related to skincare products and routines.

### 1. Collecting Data

The first step is to collect a diverse set of conversational data related to the task. This includes:

- **Customer Support Conversations**: Extract dialogues from customer support channels where common skincare concerns and product inquiries are discussed.
- **Product Descriptions**: Gather detailed descriptions of skincare products, including ingredients, usage instructions, and benefits.
- **FAQs**: Compile a list of frequently asked questions and answers from the company website or customer support.
- **Reviews and Feedback**: Analyze customer reviews and feedback to understand common sentiments and issues.

### 2. Structuring Data

To ensure consistency and facilitate training, the collected data should be structured in a standardized format. We will use a simple JSON format where each conversation entry includes the following fields:

- **Context**: The initial query or context provided by the user.
- **Response**: The expected response from the chatbot.

**Example:**

```json
{
  "conversations": [
    {
      "prompt": "Can you tell me more about the pimple serum?",
      "completion": "Our serum is a dual-action acne treatment formulated with benzoyl peroxide and lipo-hydroxy acid. It helps to reduce acne, prevent future breakouts, and minimize the appearance of pores."
    }
  ]
}
```
### 3. Tips for Effective Data Preparation

- Diversity: Ensure that your dataset covers a wide range of possible user queries and scenarios to make the chatbot robust.
- Quality: High-quality, error-free data leads to better model performance. Clean the data to remove any inconsistencies or irrelevant information.
- Balance: Maintain a balanced dataset where all topics and types of queries are adequately represented to prevent the model from being biased towards specific responses.
- Contextual Relevance: Include enough context in each conversation entry to help the model understand and generate relevant responses.

## Fine-Tuning Process
The fine-tuning process uses the Hugging Face Trainer with LoRA adapters to efficiently train the Mistral model on your custom chatbot dataset.
### Steps to Fine-Tune:

1. Prepare Dataset: Tokenize the dataset using the tokenizer for Mistral.
  ```python
dataset = dataset.map(tokenize_dataset)
  ```
2. Initialize the Trainer:
  ```python
trainer = SFTTrainer(
    model=base_model,
    train_dataset=dataset,
    peft_config=peft_config,
    max_seq_length=256,
    tokenizer=tokenizer,
    args=training_arguments,
    packing=packing,
    dataset_text_field='chat'
)
  ```
3. Train the Model: Start the training process.
  ```python
    trainer.train()
```

## Saving the Model
After fine-tuning the model, it's important to properly save the LoRA adapters and merge them with the base model to ensure the model is ready for inference.
1. Save LoRA Adapters:
  ```python
trainer.model.save_pretrained("path_to_save_adapters")
```
2. Reload the Base Model and Merge Adapters:
  ```python
base_model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained('path_to_base_model')
base_model = base_model.merge_and_unload("path_to_save_adapters")
```
3. Save the Final Model:
  ```python
base_model.save_pretrained("path_to_final_model")
```

## Combining Safetensors
In case the fine-tuning process produces multiple safetensors files, you can combine them into a single file for easier deployment.


## Usage
Once the model is fine-tuned and merged, you can load it for inference using the following command:
```python
from transformers import AutoModelForCausalLM, AutoTokenizer

tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained("path_to_final_model")
model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained("path_to_final_model")

# Chatbot Inference
inputs = tokenizer("Your input text here", return_tensors="pt")
outputs = model.generate(**inputs)
print(tokenizer.decode(outputs[0], skip_special_tokens=True))
```
